Clone the repo and use command "npm start" in the file's directory via command prompt. This will launch my application into your browser for veiwing and testing at your pleasure.

NOTE: I have disabled connection to the backend so you cannot sign-up. Your name won't be saved or displayed, as well as your total photo entry count will not be saved or dispayed as user information normally would be stored in a backend database.
